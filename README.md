# Eatry Server-Side Application

## Objective

This project aims to develop authentication and two more endpoints with server-side app; that will cater an eatery. The project uses MongoDB as its data store, Postman for API-driven software development (ADSD), and GitHub as version control system

## Requirements

### 1. Authentication Endpoint
- Implement user registration and login functionality using a chosen authentication framework (e.g., Passport.js) or email and password.
- Ensure proper password hashing and verification.

### 2. Eatry Endpoints
- **Menu Endpoint:** Created an endpoint to retrieve the eatery's menu, including dish names, descriptions, and prices.
- **Order Endpoint:** Develop an endpoint to process orders, accepting dish IDs and quantities, and returning a confirmation message.

### 3. API Testing and Documentation
- Use Postman to test and document the API endpoints, including request and response examples.

### 4. Database Management
- Design a MongoDB schema to store users, menu items, and orders.
- Implement CRUD operations for each collection as needed.

### 5. Deployment
- Deploy the application to a chosen platform (e.g., Render, GCP, Swiftwave, etc.).
- Provide a live URL for testing and evaluation.

### 6. GitHub Repository
- Create a GitHub repository for the project, including all source code and documentation.
- Ensure proper commit history and version control (not less than 5 commits).
